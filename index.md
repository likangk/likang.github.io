## Projects
### Image Clustering (2020.05 - 2020.10)
Combined autoencoder with the soft clustering algorithm FCM of traditional machine learning by integrating the iterative formula of FCM into the loss function of deep autoencoder. Solved the problem that the iterative algorithm K-means cannot be directly combined with the gradient update of deep learning which requires continuous derivation.

### Use Spectrum to Predict Solution Concentration (2020.11 - 2021.01)
Applied self-supervised learning to reduce the dimension of the spectral data of the high-dimensional biological fermentation solution and further used traditional machine learning methods for regression prediction. Achieved high-precision predicted concentration of the solution components using only the spectral data, allowing real-time monitoring of biological fermentation production.

### Image Generation (2021.02 - 2021.07)
Applied the GAN-based pix2pix model to the conversion between medical images CT and MRI. Further promoted the pix2pix model to a model which uses one-dimensional signal to generate two-dimensional image for restoring the cell signal into an image.
